## The Problem

API tokens, JWT tokens, and secrets are constantly leaked through accidental commits, environment misconfigurations, and poor rotation practices. Once exposed, these tokens create significant security vulnerabilities that often go undetected until it's too late.

## The Solution

TokenGuardian provides multi-layered protection for your tokens and secrets:

1. **Leak Prevention** - Git pre-commit hooks that scan for potential token patterns across multiple formats
2. **Validation** - Runtime token validation that verifies entropy and format compliance
3. **Rotation** - Automated token rotation capabilities with common services (AWS, GCP, GitHub, etc.)
4. **Monitoring** - Token canary system that alerts when exposed credentials are used
5. **Tracking** - Fingerprinting to track token usage across systems

## Installation

```bash
npm install token-guardian
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { TokenGuardian } from 'token-guardian';

// Initialize TokenGuardian with your configuration
const guardian = new TokenGuardian({
  services: ['github', 'aws'],
  rotationInterval: '7d',
  canaryEnabled: true
});

// Check if a string contains potential tokens or secrets
const hasSensitiveData = guardian.scanString('My API key is sk_test_1234567890abcdef');

// Protect your tokens and enable rotation
guardian.protect('GITHUB_TOKEN', process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN, {
  rotationEnabled: true,
  canaryEnabled: true
});

// Get a protected token
const token = guardian.getToken('GITHUB_TOKEN');
```

## Features

### üîç Token Detection

TokenGuardian can detect over 150 different token formats, including:

- API Keys (AWS, GitHub, Stripe, etc.)
- JWT Tokens
- OAuth Tokens
- Private Keys (SSH, RSA, etc.)
- Cryptocurrency Private Keys
- Database Connection Strings

### üîÑ Automated Rotation

TokenGuardian can automatically rotate tokens for supported services before they expire or according to your security policy.

### üïµÔ∏è Canary Tokens

Embed undetectable canary markers in your tokens to be alerted when they're used outside your authorized systems.

### üåê Token Fingerprinting

Track where and how your tokens are being used across your infrastructure.

## Security

TokenGuardian takes a zero-trust approach to token security. All sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
